What is wrong with the following program statement?
char letter = "Z";

/* Write your answer below.
************************************************************************************************
 "Z" is enclosed in double quotes (" "), which makes it a string literal.
The char data type can only hold a single character, which must be enclosed in **single quotes (' ').
