1. How many operands does each of the following types of operators require?
    _1______ Unary
    ___2____ Binary
    __3_____ Ternary

2. How may the double variables temp, weight, and age be defined in one statement?

This declares three double variables in a single statement.

3. How can the values of three variables length, breadth, and height be displayed
using one statement, such that each variable is displayed in a new line?

endl ensures that each variable is printed on a new line.

4. Assume that x is an integer variable, y is a floating-point variable, and z is a character
variable. Write statements in C++ to perform the following operations:

    (A) Add 10 to x.
x += 10;x += 10;
    (B) Square the value of y.
y = y * y;
    (C) Divide x by 7 and store the result in y.
y = static_cast<float>(x) / 7;
    (D) Store '&' in z.
z = '&';
    (E) Display the values of y and z on the screen.
cout << y << " " << z << endl;
    (F) Display the rightmost digit of x on the screen.
cout << x % 10 << endl;
    (G) Display the number of bytes used by an integer variable.
cout << sizeof(int) << endl;

5. Is the following comment written using single-line or multi-line comment symbols?
    /* This program was written by M. A. Codewriter*/ 

    multi-line comment format.


6. Is the following comment written using single-line or multi-line comment symbols?
    // This program was written by M. A. Codewriter

Single-line Comment

7. Modify the following program so it prints two blank lines between each line of text.

    #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Two mandolins like creatures in the\n\n\n";
    cout << "dark\n\n\n";
    cout << "Creating the agony of ecstasy.\n\n\n";
    cout << "                    - George Barker\n\n";
    return 0;
}


8. What will the following programs print on the screen?

    (A) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        int main()
        {
            int freeze = 32, boil = 212;
            freeze = 0;
            boil = 100;
            cout << freeze << endl << boil << endl;
            return 0;
        }

0
100

    (B) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            int x = 0, y = 2;
            x = y * 4;
            cout << x << endl << y << endl;
            return 0;
        }

    (C) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            cout << "I am the incredible";
            cout << "computing\nmachine";
            cout << "\nand I will\namaze\n";
            cout << "you.";
            return 0;
        }
        I am the incrediblecomputing
        machine
        and I will
        amaze
        you.


    (D) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            cout << "Be careful\n";
            cout << "This might/n be a trick ";
            cout << "question\n";
            return 0;
        }

        Be careful
        This might/n be a trick question

    (E) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        int main()
        {
            int a, x = 23;
            a = x % 2;
            cout << x << endl << a << endl;
            return 0;
        }

        23
