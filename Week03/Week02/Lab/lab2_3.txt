1. Create a new file in the Week02/Lab/ folder called circlearea.cpp
2. Copy the below code into the file.
3. Fill in the missing code in the program so that
   it will compute the area of a circle with a radius of 5.4
   and output the result. The formula for the area of a circle is
   pi times the radius squared. The program should also output the 
   circumference of the circle. The formula for the circumference 
   of a circle is 2 times pi times the radius.
4. Test the program and make sure it works.
5. Push your changes to GitHub


/*************** COPY BELOW ***************/
// This program will output the circumference and area
// of the circle with a given radius.
