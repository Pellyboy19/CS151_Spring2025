ANSWER BELOW
*******************************************************************************

cos(x)

Calculates the cosine of the argument 
𝑥
x, where 
𝑥
x is in radians.
log(x)

Calculates the natural (base 
𝑒
e) logarithm of 
𝑥
x.
sin(x)

Calculates the sine of the argument 
𝑥
x, where 
𝑥
x is in radians.
exp(x)

Returns 
𝑒
𝑥
e 
x
 , where 
𝑒
e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).
log10(x)

Calculates the common (base 10) logarithm of 
𝑥
x.
sqrt(x)

Returns the non-negative square root of 
𝑥
x.
fmod(x, y)

Computes the remainder of the division 
𝑥
÷
𝑦
x÷y.
pow(x, y)

Raises 
𝑥
x to the power of 
𝑦
y (i.e., 
𝑥
𝑦
x 
y
 ).
tan(x)

Calculates the tangent of the argument 
𝑥
x, where 
𝑥
x is in radians.
