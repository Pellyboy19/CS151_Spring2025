Explain why you cannot convert the following if/else if statement into a
switch statement.
if (temp == 100)
    x = 0;
else if (population > 1000)
    x = 1;
else if (rate < .1)
    x = âˆ’1;

ANSWER BELOW
*******************************************************************************
You cannot convert this if/else if statement into a switch statement because:

A switch statement only works with discrete, constant values (like integers or characters).
It does not support relational operators such as >, <, or expressions involving floating-point numbers.
In this example:
temp == 100 is fine for a switch (it's equality).
But population > 1000 and rate < .1 are relational comparisons, not constant equality checks.
rate < .1 also involves a floating-point value, which is not allowed in switch conditions.
Therefore, a switch cannot be used because it:

Requires integral types (like int or char),
Cannot evaluate expressions or ranges,
Cannot handle floating-point comparisons.
