What is the difference between a static local variable and a global variable?

ANSWER BELOW
*****************************************************************
A static local variable is declared inside a function and retains its value between function calls, but it is only accessible within that function.

A global variable is declared outside all functions and is accessible by all functions in the program. However, global variables can lead to unintended side effects if not managed carefully.

In short:

Static local → limited scope, retains value

Global → wide scope, always accessible
