What is the difference between an arrayâ€™s size declarator and a subscript?

ANSWER BELOW
************************************************************************
The size declarator is the number used when you create the array. It tells how many elements the array can hold.

The subscript is the index number used to access or change a specific element in the array. Subscripts start at 0 and go up to one less than the size.
