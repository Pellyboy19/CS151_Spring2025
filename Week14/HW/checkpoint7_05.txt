What is “array bounds checking”? Does C++ perform it?

ANSWER BELOW
************************************************************************
Array bounds checking means making sure that you don’t use a subscript that’s outside the valid range of an array (like using index 5 in a 4-element array).

C++ does not perform array bounds checking.
This means if you use an invalid subscript, the program might run but could give wrong results or crash. It’s up to the programmer to be careful.
