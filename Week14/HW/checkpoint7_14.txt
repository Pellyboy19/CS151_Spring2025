Given the following array definitions:

double array1[4] = {1.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2};
double array2[4];

Will the following statement work? If not, why?

array2 = array1;

ANSWER BELOW
************************************************************************
No, the statement will NOT work.

In C++, you cannot assign one array to another using the assignment operator (=).
Arrays do not support direct assignment like that.
